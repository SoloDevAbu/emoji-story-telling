# Emoji Story Telling

## Project Overview

Emoji Story Telling is a unique project that generates a story based on the user's input emojis. Users can only use emojis as prompts, and based on these emojis, a story will be generated and saved in the database. New users can explore stories generated by other users or create their own. In the future, we plan to include a leaderboard functionality for the most liked story.

## Features

- Generate stories based on emoji prompts
- Save generated stories in the database
- Explore stories created by other users
- Create and save your own stories
- Future: Leaderboard for the most liked story
